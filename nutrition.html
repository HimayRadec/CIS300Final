        <h3>Water</h3>
        <p>
            Some of the benefits water provides is it flushes out toxins and other metabolic wastes from the body.
            When following a high protein diet this is extremely imporant. You should aim to consume
            1/2 to 1 fl oz of water per pound of body weight.

        <h3>Nutrition For Cutting</h3>
        <p>
            Cutting is when you are losing weight in an attempt to cut body fat.
            When cutting it is recommended to eat a minimum of 1.5g-2g of protein per pound of body weight.
            In order to lose weight you must be a in a caloric deficit. A recommended deficit is around 200-500 calories per day.
            It is not recommended that you lose more than 2 lbs per week in order to hold on to as much muscle mass as possible.
            When cutting you will tend to lose some muscle mass, but will hopefully be a very negligible amount as long as your nutrition is on point
            and your training.

        <h3>Nutrition For Bulking</h3>
        <p>
            Bulking is when you are gaining weight in an attempt to put on muscle.
            When bulking it is recommended to eat a minimum of 1g-2g of protein per pound of body weight.
            In order to gain weight you must be in a caloric surplus. A recommend surplus is around 300-500 calories per day.
            It is not recommend that you gain more than 4 lbs of weight per weak if your goal is minimize fat gain while maximizing muscle growth.
            The more weight you gain in a shorter period the more likely you are to put on fat. When cutting you will put on fat regardless.
            The amount of fat gained depends on the surplus of your calories.
